# Bubble-Sort-Ruby
Sorting algorithms are some of the earliest that you typically get exposed to in Computer Science. It may not be immediately obvious how important they are, but it shouldn't be hard to think of some examples where your computer needs to sort some massive datasets during everyday operations.

This is a bubble sort algorithm using Ruby, made by Microverse students [Phemia Ampaire](https://github.com/ampaire) and [David Elí Martínez García](https://github.com/davitomix), as part of the Ruby Curriculum.
